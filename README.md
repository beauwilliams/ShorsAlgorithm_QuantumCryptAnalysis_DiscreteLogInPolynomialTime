# A Quantum Enhanced Exercise in Cryptanalysis

## Demonstrating Shor's Algorithm 'On Paper' using GPari Calculator

..There may be other cryptanalytic techniques on the horizon that utilise quantum effects 👀

For now at least, Shor's is the *most powerful algorithm* we have found that can attack the **discrete logarithm problem** (finding the prime numbers which multiply to give you a number 'N') in polynomial time.

**In layman terms**, with Shors, and a general purpose quantum computer (we're working on that..), **or** a specifically built curcuit (have to build a brand new circuit for each application!) *an attacker can potentially crack your password in a realistic amount of time*
